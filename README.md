# Crosschain Request of a Chainlink VRF with Gnosis's Hashi 🌉

This project demonstrates how to use the Yaho and Yaru contracts, part of the Gnosis's Hashi protocol, to send a crosschain message to a Chainlink VRF contract and listen for the response event.
Hashi Protocol 🌉

Hashi is an EVM Header Oracle Aggregator, designed to facilitate a principled approach to cross-chain bridge security. It allows users to build custom oracle adapter contracts for any hash oracle mechanism they would like to use. Yaho and Yaru are contracts within the Hashi protocol that facilitate crosschain communication.

- Yaho allows users to dispatch arbitrary messages, store the arbitrary message in storage, and relay previously stored messages to any number of message adapters.
- Yaru allows the execution of arbitrary messages passed from Yaho.

### Steps 🚶‍♂️

1. Instantiate the Contracts: Instantiate the Yaho, Yaru, and Chainlink VRF contracts using their respective ABIs and addresses.

2. Prepare the VRF Request Message: Prepare a message to request a VRF. The message includes the chain ID of the destination chain (Goerli), the address of the VRF contract, and the encoded function data for the requestRandomWords function of the VRF contract.

3. Dispatch the Message: Dispatch the message through the Yaho contract on the Chiado chain. The dispatchMessagesToAdapters function takes an array of messages, an array of adapter addresses, and an array of destination adapter addresses.

4. Execute the Message: After the dispatch transaction is confirmed, extract the message ID from the event logs of the dispatch receipt. Then execute the message on the Goerli chain using the Yaru contract.

5. Listen for the VRF Response: After executing the message, start listening for the VRF response event on the Goerli chain.

### Use Cases 🎯

Being able to request VRF crosschain opens up a lot of possibilities for decentralized applications. For example, a dApp on one chain could use a random number generated by a Chainlink VRF on another chain. This could be useful for dApps that need secure, verifiable randomness but are running on a chain where Chainlink VRF is not available or too expensive to use.
